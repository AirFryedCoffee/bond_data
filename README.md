# bond_data
I used Jupyter Notebooks along with Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib in order to see if there was any correlation with the 10 Year Treasury Yield, and Unemployment numbers in the US economy/financial markets.

In this project I downloaded 2 CSV files from the Federal Reserves website. The two CSV files that I downloaded were related to the 10 Year Treasury Yield, as well as Unemployment numbers. I cleaned up the data a little bit, took out some of the data that were missing values, and then summarized the 10 Year data, as this data was provided on a daily basis, while the Unemployment data was provided as monthly data. 

I found the monthly average of the 10 year treasury yield, and then merged the two data frames. I then plotted the two data frames using Matplotlib, and examined the results. 

In conclusion I think that there were probably better things that I could have used to comopare to the US 10 Year Treasury Yield, instead of Unemplpoyment numbers. But I learned a great deal regarding these very useful Python libraries, and the data cleaning/analysis project in general.
